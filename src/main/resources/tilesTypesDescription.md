The tiles types can be the following

* Ground -- represents ground tiles. Ideally it should be <= 1 ground tile in the same coordinate per level 
  * Wall -- synonym for the ground, default is not passable
* Object -- any tile which stays on the ground and interact with the world somehow
* Decoration -- any decoration which does not affect the game logic
